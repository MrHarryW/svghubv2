# SVG Hub

A modern Next.js application for SVG management and conversion.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure your repository is public (GitHub Pages requires this for free accounts)
2. Ensure you have the main branch as your default branch

### Automatic Deployment

The project uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. **Push to main branch**: Any push to the main branch will trigger a build and deployment
2. **Pull requests**: Pull requests will trigger a build for testing but won't deploy

### Manual Setup (if needed)

If you need to set up GitHub Pages manually:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. The workflow will automatically handle the rest
